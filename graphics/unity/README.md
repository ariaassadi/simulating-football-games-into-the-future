## Overview

## Script Structure

The scripts are organized into several directories:

- `Camera/`: Scripts related to camera controls and settings.
- `Game/`: Core game logic and management scripts.
- `Old/`: Deprecated scripts kept for historical reference.
- `TimeManipulation/`: Scripts for handling time-related manipulations in the game.
- `Tools/`: Utility tools for gameplay enhancement like distance calculation and player movement.
- `UI/`: User Interface scripts for menu options, scoreboard, and other UI elements.
- `Utils/`: Utility scripts including theme management and JSON parsing.

## Setup

To use these scripts in your Unity project:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Import the scripts into your Unity project.
3. Ensure all dependencies are resolved, particularly if the project uses external libraries or Unity packages.

## Usage

- Integrate the `CameraController.cs` for advanced camera controls.
- Use `GameLogicManager.cs` to handle the main game operations.
- Employ `UI/MenuManager.cs` to manage in-game menus and interfaces.
