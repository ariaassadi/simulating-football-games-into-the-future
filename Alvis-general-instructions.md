# General Instructions for ALVIS
Here are some general guidielines regarding how to use ALVIS:
* ALVIS can only be accessed through Eduroam.
* We cannot use commands like `sudo apt update`, `sudo apt install`, or `pip install`.
* We do not have sudo privileges.
* Although we have 500 GB of storage, this is only applicable when we store files in `/mimer/NOBACKUPS/groups/two_seconds_football/`.
* In our own home directories, we are limited to 60,000 files. Be careful not to exceed this. Installing more than one virtual environment will likely reach the file limit.
* The ALVIS instance can be launched to desktop, Jupyter, and VSCode.

## How to Run ALVIS
Due to the many rules regarding the use of ALVIS, we have provided instructions for running ALVIS. There are two sets of instructions: one for Jupyter (`/Alvis-setup-jupyter.md`), and one for VSCode (`/Alvis-setup-vscode.md`). Follow the one you prefer; we slightly favour VSCode.
